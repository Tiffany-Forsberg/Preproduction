Capsley: Hello, I am Mr Capsley.
Capsley: Who are you then?

-> I'm Capsule, but my friends call me "Tic Tac". No idea why...
    <<set $player_name to "Tic Tac">>
-> The name's Triquandle.
    <<set $player_name to "Triquandle">>
-> Pyramid. Why - who wants to know?
    <<set $player_name to "Pyramid">>
    <<set $capsley_likes_you to false>>

<<if $capsley_likes_you>>
    Capsley: Nice to meet you {$player_name}!
<<else>>
    Capsley: No need to be so rude...
    Capsley: Maybe you should be called Grumpy {$player_name}.
